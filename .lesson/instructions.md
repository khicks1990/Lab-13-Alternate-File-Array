Design a class that has a static method named WriteArray. The method should take two arguments: the name of a file and a reference to an int array. The file should be opened as a binary file, the contents of the array should be written to the file, and then the file should be closed.
Write a second method in the class named ReadArray. The method should take two arguments: the name of a file and a reference to an int array. The file should be opened, data should be read from the file and stored in the array, and then the file should be closed.
